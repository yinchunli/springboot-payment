#Logs
Lomok sl4j is used in application level log, and log level is set to info level. Hibernate SQL is turned on. 

# Current Status and Enhancement

Application is successfully up running, Full filled the requirement on server side, directly service call from standalone application.

Rest Service is operated correctly on top of SpringBoot

CRUD function is operated correctly on H2

Service side implementation on all functions

System has been unit test which preformed all mock service call based on the require ment

# To Be Enhanced
Because of the time limitation, I have left some features for future enhancement which is not specified in the documents.
(1) Security, it would be nice to add Spring Security in
(2) Validation, input and output validation
(3) Exception Handler along with log mechanism.
(4) Build docker image, and push to docker hub, so the application can be easily retrieved by user.
